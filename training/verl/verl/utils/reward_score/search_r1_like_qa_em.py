#### For LLM-as-a-judge Evaluation
INSTRUCTIONS = """Assume you are a human expert in grading predictions given by a model. You are given a question and a model prediction. Judge if the prediction matches the ground truth answer by following these steps:
1: Take it as granted that the Ground Truth is always correct.
2: If the Prediction exactly matches the Ground Truth, "score" is 1.
3: If the Prediction does not exactly match the Ground Truth, go through the following steps and likely give a score as 0.
4: If the Ground Truth is a number, "score" is 1 if and only if the Prediction gives a number that almost exactly matches the ground truth.
5: If the Prediction is self-contradictory, "score" must be 0.
6: If the prediction is not answering the question, "score" must be 0.
7: If the prediction is a concise and correct summary of the ground truth, "score" is 1.
8: If ground truth contains a set of items, prediction must contain exactly same items for the score to be 1.
9: Otherwise, "score" is 0.

However, it does not provide the total number of live-action movies.\n\nSince Document [1] provides a specific number of live-action Disney movies (15) and it is the most relevant and up-to-date information, we can rely on this source to answer the question.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the query time, which is 03/17/2024. Document [1] was written in 2023, and it lists 15 live-action Disney movies. Document [4] mentions that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is set to be released on March 22, 2024, which is after the query time.

Question: "how many heb locations are in austin, tx?"
Ground Truth: "26"
Reasoning: "<think> \nTo answer the question \"how many H-E-B locations are in Austin, TX?\", we need to find information about the number of H-E-B locations in Austin, TX from the given references.\n\nFrom Document [2], we can see that H-E-B operates over 50 stores in Austin and the surrounding area. However, this information does not specify the exact number of locations in Austin.\n\nFrom Document [8], we can see that H-E-B plans to open three new stores in South Austin, but this information does not specify the current number of locations in Austin.\n\nFrom Document [7], we can see that there is a list of H-E-B locations with their addresses, but it does not specify the number of locations in Austin.\n\nHowever, from Document [1], we can see that the state with the most number of H-E-B locations in the US is Texas, with 333 stores, which is about 100% of all H-E-B stores in the US. Since Austin is a city in Texas, we can assume that the number of H-E-B locations in Austin is a significant portion of the total number of H-E-B locations in Texas.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can conclude that the number of H-E-B locations in Austin, TX is likely to be a significant portion of the total number of H-E-B locations in Texas, which is 333.

However, it mentions that Microsoft Corp.

Since the query time is in February 2024, and Joe Biden's birthday is on November 20, we need to subtract the age he would have been on February 26 from his actual age. \n\nJoe Biden's age on February 26, 2024, would be 81 years old. \n\nTherefore, the current president's age is 81.</think>\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{81}"
